# nodejs-reactjs-chat

Here, we are going to build a full-stack, realtime chat app with Node JS, React JS and ChatEngine.io.

[ChatEngine.io](https://chatengine.io/) provides full-stack chat tools - which makes adding chat into Node apps easy.

Go to ChatEngine.io, sign up, and create your first project. Once this is done, youâ€™ll see a Project ID and a Private Key.
